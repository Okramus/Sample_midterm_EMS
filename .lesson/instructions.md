# Sample Final Economic Modeling and Simulation

Important: the midterm is different from the sample in significant ways, so if you just copy-paste the code your solutions will be most likely wrong and your grade will be penalized. If I detect errors that show that you have __copied from another classmate, your grade will me penalized__ even more.

This exam is open-book: you may also lookup on the internet as long as you do not communicate with your classmates or anyone else.

The total amount of points is 100, but you can get up to 15 bonus points if your code is clean and/or elegant. In other words, you do not need to get everything right to get the maximum grade. However, it is __critical that the code runs__ and that there are no execution errors: a code that runs but that misses some calculations will be graded benevolently; a code that does not run will not.
